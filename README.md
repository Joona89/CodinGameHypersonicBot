# CodinGameHypersonicBot

A bot for codingame competition. This is made only for the competition.

Code is written as fast as possible, because of the timelimit. Its managed poorly and propably filled with mistakes. Since i didnt win the competition clearly it is not the best either. 

Embrace yourself before looking at the code.
