# CodinGameHypersonicBot

A bot for codingame competition. This is made only for the competition.

Code is written as fast as possible, because of the timelimit. Its managed poorly and propably filled with mistakes. Since I didnt win the competition, it is not the best either. 

Embrace yourself before looking at the code. 

Credits to Two-Cats Blog for the A Star Pathfinding, which I borrowed for this.

Sorry, Its all in one file, because of the codingame IDE.

Since the competition is over, codingame moved it to multiplayer "games". So it is still fighting there. Nickname is Balthar.
